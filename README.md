OSU Winter Hackathon 2018

This C++ game was created for Oregon State University's Winter Hackathon 2018. The hackathon's theme was REWIND. Toward that theme, we decided to make a text-based adventure game like the ones we played in our childhoods. Our game, Murder He Wrote, asks the player to solve a mystery: their own murder! They explore their apartment as a ghost and search for clues as to who murdered them. The game ends when the player chooses someone to haunt. 

Since all of the students involved had only completed OSU's introductory programming course, we faced many challenges. The first was learning how to use version control. It was our first time using Git and Github, which meant that every merge conflict was a bit of a headache! It was also difficult figuring out how to incorporate the text file that contained the game's story. Lastly, writing the story within the Hackathon's 3-day time limit meant that the story needed to stay simple. 

If we had enough time, we would have added more features, such as letting the player choose their own name; clarifying the rules at each step in the game; and expanding the number of choices the player has while exploring the apartment. Still, we are proud of what our team of new programmers was able to achieve!
