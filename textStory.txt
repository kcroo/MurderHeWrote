Note: This is incomplete as I just used for general testing. 

[INTRODUCTION]
You wake up feeling much lighter than usual. Floating, in fact.

You turn around and see your BODY sitting on the TOILET, hunched over.
Wait, if that’s your BODY, then you must be… dead. Oh no!
What’s worse, is that you seem to have died on the TOILET. What terrible luck!
What if they find you on the TOILET? That will be too embarrassing.
How did you die? Were you… murdered?! Who would want to murder a nerdy,
overachieving, socially inept computer science college student?
(Hey, we’re just being honest here!) 

Still, maybe you should search for clues to find out how you died. Try looking 
around the BATHROOM, then move to different rooms in your apartment. 
Once you’ve searched your apartment, you can choose to haunt who 
you think your murderer is. Because ghosts are petty like that.

[LOOK BATHROOM]
It’s a bathroom. 
There’s a TOILET, SINK, MIRROR, and TUB. 
Everything is filthy, because you’re a disgusting, 
young adult college student. (Sorry, but the truth hurts.)

[LOOK BODY]
Yup, that’s you. You’ve seen better days. 
Your hair is a mess, you have a sizeable pimple on your chin,
and there’s a large GASH on your forehead. 
You smell very bad, probably because you’re dead. 
And is that the scent of CAT urine? Hm.

[LOOK GASH]
The GASH is a cut about an inch long above your left eye. 
How did that get there? Sure, you’re kind of a klutz but
can normally remember when you run into things.
